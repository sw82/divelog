A maps thingy to keep track of my dives.
Done with Vibe Coding.


## ToDo

- [x] Initial Commit
- [x] Add Geolocation and geocode
- [x] Show Map
- [x] git
- [ ] can the list of fish be a list of fish in the database or a smart way to keep track of all - I later want to get images of the fish I've seen from Wikipedia or the web (once found they need to be storead as well so we don't need to look them up every time again). 
- [ ] color code the years
- [ ] list of fish seen
- [ ] create a smart way to add my old log book

## Project Changes

This project has undergone a major restructuring:

- Moved from Node.js/Express/MongoDB stack to PHP/MySQL implementation
- Created dive log system with robust database schema
- Added support for:
  - Dive location tracking with interactive map visualization
  - Comprehensive dive metrics (depth, duration, temperature, etc.)
  - Image uploads for each dive
  - Year-based filtering
  - Dive site categorization
  - Ratings system
- Simplified architecture for easier maintenance and self-hosting
