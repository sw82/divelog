A maps thingy to keep track of my dives.
Done with Vibe Coding.


ToDo

- [x] Initial Commit
- [x] Add Geolocation and geocode
- [x] Show Map
- [ ] can the list of fish be a list of fish in the database or a smart way to keep track of all - I later want to get images of the fish I've seen from Wikipedia. 
- [ ] color code the years
- [ ] create a smart way to add my old log book
